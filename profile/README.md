# Welcome to ELedlow Studios

Greetings form **ELedlow Studios**, an organization whose goal is to create open-source engines that promote unlimited creativity.

If you have interest in becoming a part of [ELedlow Studios](https://github.com/ELedlow-Studios), we invite you to reach out to us. Please feel free to contact [Breakout-X on Github](https://github.com/Breakout-X/), or [ELedlow on Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ELedlow/) for any questions or requests.

We look forward to collaborating with you soon.

By using or contributing to our repositories, you agree to Github's [TOS](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and our [TOS](https://github.com/ELedlow-Studios/ELedlow-Studios/).

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that if you are joining us, we do have some requirements aside from usage of our services.
>
> As we work together on our organization's repositories, sites, apps, and data, we have established a set of guidelines to ensure a smooth and productive experience for everyone.
>
> These guidelines are designed to be straightforward and easy to follow and are not meant to be burdensome, but rather to **ensure we adhere to best practices and maintain the high quality of our work**.
>
> First, although we value the contributions of all our members, regardless of age, religion, race, gender, and etc., we simply require that all developers **have respect for one another**, even if they are of different origins. This should be obvious as this is part of [Github's community guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines#what-if-something-or-someone-offends-you)
>
> Second, we **are not** in support of any sort of drama. If any dramas rise regarding the developers in the organization, we as a whole are **not responsible**.
>
> Third, the administrators of the organization reserve the right to take down **any projects or repositories within the organization, with or without notice**.

-------
We hope these guidelines are clear and we look forward to your contributions in the future, whether as a user or developer.
Please contact us if you find any bugs in our programs.
